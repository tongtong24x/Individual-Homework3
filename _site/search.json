Most countries have a life expectancy between 60 and 80 years, with a small number of outliers on both ends. This reflects disparities between developed and developing nations, where factors like healthcare access and socio-economic status play a significant role.\n\n# Life expectancy histogram\nggplot(dataset, aes(x = Life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Life Expectancy\",\n    x = \"Life Expectancy (years)\",\n    y = \"Frequency\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhe boxplot highlights regional differences in life expectancy:\nAfrica has the lowest median life expectancy, likely due to higher disease prevalence, lower immunization rates, and economic challenges. Europe, North America, and Oceania exhibit the highest life expectancy, supported by robust healthcare systems and higher GDP. Asia and South America show moderate life expectancy with notable variation across countries.\n\n# Life expectancy by region (boxplot)\nggplot(dataset, aes(x = Region, y = Life_expectancy, fill = Region)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Life Expectancy by Region\",\n    x = \"Region\",\n    y = \"Life Expectancy (years)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###Predictive Modeling\nObjective\nDevelop a linear regression model to predict life expectancy based on key indicators:\nGDP_per_capita: Represents economic prosperity.\nSchooling: Average years of education, reflecting access to knowledge.\nInfant_deaths: A critical health indicator, inversely correlated with life expectancy.\n\nset.seed(123)\ntraining_index &lt;- sample(1:nrow(dataset), 0.8 * nrow(dataset))\ntraining_set &lt;- dataset[training_index, ]\ntest_set &lt;- dataset[-training_index, ]\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(Life_expectancy ~ GDP_per_capita + Schooling + Infant_deaths, data = dataset)\n\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Life_expectancy ~ GDP_per_capita + Schooling + Infant_deaths, \n    data = dataset)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-13.1502  -1.3384   0.3706   2.0890   9.3299 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

A higher GDP indicates better access to healthcare and improved living standards.\nSchooling: Negatively correlated, though marginally significant (p = 0.0481). This counterintuitive result may reflect collinearity with other predictors.\nInfant_deaths: Strong negative correlation, highlighting its critical impact on life expectancy.\nThis low RMSE reflects accurate predictions of life expectancy across countries.\n###Actual vs Predicted Life Expectancy\nThe scatter plot below shows predicted vs actual life expectancy. The points cluster closely around the diagonal line, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness.\n\nggplot(test_set, aes(x = Life_expectancy, y = Predicted_Life_Expectancy)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Actual vs Predicted Life Expectancy\",\n    x = \"Actual Life Expectancy (years)\",\n    y = \"Predicted Life Expectancy (years)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###Conclusion\nThe analysis highlights that GDP_per_capita and Infant_deaths are the strongest predictors of life expectancy. Countries with higher GDP per capita typically enjoy better access to healthcare and improved living standards, which directly contribute to longer life spans. Conversely, high infant mortality rates have a significant negative impact on life expectancy, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to improve maternal and child healthcare. The role of Schooling, however, requires further investigation. While it showed a marginally significant negative correlation in this model, this result could stem from multicollinearity or complex interactions with other predictors.\nLife expectancy varies widely across regions, with Africa exhibiting the lowest averages. This disparity underscores the critical need for policies that enhance healthcare access, reduce disease burden, and improve education in under-resourced areas. In contrast, developed regions such as North America, Europe, and Oceania report consistently higher life expectancy. These findings reflect the impact of robust healthcare systems, higher economic stability, and well-developed social infrastructure in sustaining healthier populations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost With Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\ncode\n\n\nanalysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 8, 2024\n\n\nHarlow Malloc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome To My Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 5, 2024\n\n\nTristan O’Malley\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

Clothing dominates as the most popular category, followed by Accessories, Footwear, and Outerwear. This suggests that clothing is a primary focus area for customer demand. However, outerwear shows significantly lower engagement, highlighting an opportunity for targeted promotions or campaigns to boost sales in this category.\n\n# Bar plot\nggplot(dataset, aes(x = Category)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Categories\", x = \"Category\", y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.2 Predictive Analysis\nObjective: A linear regression model was constructed to predict the Purchase_Amount using Age and Review_Rating. These variables were chosen based on their potential influence on customer purchasing behavior.\n\n#Predictive Analysis:Linear regression\ndataset &lt;- dataset %&gt;%\n  rename(Purchase_Amount = Purchase.Amount..USD.)  # Simplify column name\n\ndataset &lt;- dataset %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Purchase_Amount) & Purchase_Amount &gt; 0)\n\nset.seed(123)\ntraining_index &lt;- createDataPartition(dataset$Purchase_Amount, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)\ntraining_set &lt;- dataset[training_index, ]\ntest_set &lt;- dataset[-training_index, ]\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(Purchase_Amount ~ Age + Review.Rating, data = training_set)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Purchase_Amount ~ Age + Review.Rating, data = training_set)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-41.245 -21.310   0.016  20.770  41.883 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

Age has a small, non-significant negative coefficient (-0.029), implying minimal impact on spending behavior. Review_Rating has a positive but non-significant effect (coefficient = 0.88). This suggests that higher ratings may correlate with slightly higher purchases, but the relationship is weak. The model’s Adjusted R-squared value is 0.0004, indicating that only a negligible portion of the variance in purchase amounts is explained by Age and Review_Rating. Additionally, the residual standard error (RSE) of 23.69 and the RMSE of ~23.65 highlight significant prediction errors, which are substantial relative to the purchase amount range ($20–$100).\n\n\n0.3 Visualization: Actual vs Predicted\nThe scatter plot below compares the actual and predicted purchase amounts. The wide scatter around the ideal prediction line (red dashed) reflects poor alignment between predicted and actual values, reinforcing the model’s low predictive power. This suggests that Age and Review_Rating are insufficient predictors of Purchase_Amount.\n\n#Visualization: Predicted vs Actual Spend\nggplot(test_set, aes(x = Purchase_Amount, y = Predicted_Purchase)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Actual vs Predicted Purchase Amount\", x = \"Actual Amount\", y = \"Predicted Amount\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.4 Conclusion\nThis analysis highlights key trends in customer shopping behavior and identifies opportunities to enhance predictive accuracy. While the current model does not perform well, incorporating additional variables and exploring alternative modeling techniques could significantly improve the insights derived from this dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost With Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\ncode\n\n\nanalysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 8, 2024\n\n\nHarlow Malloc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome To My Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 5, 2024\n\n\nTristan O’Malley\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

Countries with higher GDP per capita typically enjoy better access to healthcare and improved living standards, which directly contribute to longer life spans. Conversely, high infant mortality rates have a significant negative impact on life expectancy, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to improve maternal and child healthcare. The role of Schooling, however, requires further investigation. While it showed a marginally significant negative correlation in this model, this result could stem from multicollinearity or complex interactions with other predictors.\nLife expectancy varies widely across regions, with Africa exhibiting the lowest averages. This disparity underscores the critical need for policies that enhance healthcare access, reduce disease burden, and improve education in under-resourced areas. In contrast, developed regions such as North America, Europe, and Oceania report consistently higher life expectancy. These findings reflect the impact of robust healthcare systems, higher economic stability, and well-developed social infrastructure in sustaining healthier populations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

Clothing dominates as the most popular category, followed by Accessories, Footwear, and Outerwear. This suggests that clothing is a primary focus area for customer demand. However, outerwear shows significantly lower engagement, highlighting an opportunity for targeted promotions or campaigns to boost sales in this category.\n\n# Bar plot\nggplot(dataset, aes(x = Category)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Categories\", x = \"Category\", y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.2 Predictive Analysis\nObjective: A linear regression model was constructed to predict the Purchase_Amount using Age and Review_Rating.

Age has a small, non-significant negative coefficient (-0.029), implying minimal impact on spending behavior. Review_Rating has a positive but non-significant effect (coefficient = 0.88). This suggests that higher ratings may correlate with slightly higher purchases, but the relationship is weak. The model’s Adjusted R-squared value is 0.0004, indicating that only a negligible portion of the variance in purchase amounts is explained by Age and Review_Rating. Additionally, the residual standard error (RSE) of 23.69 and the RMSE of ~23.65 highlight significant prediction errors, which are substantial relative to the purchase amount range ($20–$100).\n\n\n0.3 Visualization: Actual vs Predicted\nThe scatter plot below compares the actual and predicted purchase amounts. The wide scatter around the ideal prediction line (red dashed) reflects poor alignment between predicted and actual values, reinforcing the model’s low predictive power. This suggests that Age and Review_Rating are insufficient predictors of Purchase_Amount.\n\n#Visualization: Predicted vs Actual Spend\nggplot(test_set, aes(x = Purchase_Amount, y = Predicted_Purchase)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Actual vs Predicted Purchase Amount\", x = \"Actual Amount\", y = \"Predicted Amount\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.4 Conclusion\nThis analysis highlights key trends in customer shopping behavior and identifies opportunities to enhance predictive accuracy. While the current model does not perform well, incorporating additional variables and exploring alternative modeling techniques could significantly improve the insights derived from this dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
